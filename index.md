## Welcome to Madeline's Portfolio! 

### About Me: 
I am currently attending the University of California, Davis and studying Applied Statistics. My interest in data science has only recently surfaced due to taking a Data Technology class here at Davis. Plotting and fitting models is not new to me but obtaining and cleaning data is. I hope to continue to increase that knowledge but still continue to work more with examining data and presenting it as opposed to obtaining it through scraping.
