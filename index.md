## Welcome to Madeline's Portfolio! 

### About Me: 
I am currently attending the University of California, Davis and studying Applied Statistics. My interest in data science has only recently surfaced due to taking a Data Technology class here at Davis. Plotting and fitting models is not new to me but obtaining and cleaning data is. R and R studio are my prior experience with data analysis and using Python to work with data is fairly new to me. Learning and understanding the mechanisms behind scraping data are also the reasons why I am drawn to data technology. I hope to further increase that knowledge but still continue to work more with examining data and presenting. 

### Past Work:
